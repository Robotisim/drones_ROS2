# Drones with ROS2
## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the drones with ROS2 project. The project is divided in two parts: the first one is the simulation of a drone in Gazebo and the second one is the control of a real drone with ROS2. The simulation is done with the [rotors_simulator]


## Simulation
The simulation is done with the [rotors_simulator] package. The package is a collection of Gazebo plugins and ROS2 modules for high fidelity simulation of multirotor vehicles. The package is a fork of the [rotors_simulator] package for ROS1. The simulation is done with the [rotors_gazebo_plugins] package. The package contains the plugins for the simulation of the drone. The package is a fork of the [rotors_gazebo_plugins] package for ROS1. The simulation is done with the [rotors_control] package. The package contains the controllers for the simulation of the drone. The package is a fork of the [rotors_control] package for ROS1. The simulation is done with the [rotors_description] package. The package contains the description of the drone. The package is a fork of the [rotors_description] package for ROS1. The simulation is done with the [rotors_comm] package. The package contains the messages for the simulation of the drone. The package is a fork of the [rotors_comm] package for ROS1.
